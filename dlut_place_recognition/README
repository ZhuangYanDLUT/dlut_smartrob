Software: 3D-SMART - Place Recognition
Last Modification: 2013-05-07

PREAMBLE #######################################################################

We use CMake to build 3D-SMART - Place Recognition, so you need to install CMake
on your system. The CMakeLists.txt, which is analogous to a Makefile as used by
make, will tell CMake how to build it.

If you're unfamiliar with CMakeLists.txt, that's ok, because place_recognition
follows a very simple pattern. Of course, you can always understand or use the
full power of CMake, for which you may want to consult the CMake documentation
(http://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_2.8.11_Docs).


INSTALLATION ###################################################################

The detailed preconditions are:

  - Ubuntu 12.04, 32bit Version (see your /etc/issue and the output of uname -m)
  - ROS fuerte is installed 
  - Qt4 installed as default Qt version (check/change with "update-alternatives 
    --display qmake")

If you don't own them on your operation system, please install them one by one.

The remainder of this description assumes you chose ~/ros_workspace/ as your 
personal package path. Otherwise you need to adapt the paths below, where 
~/ros_workspace is contained to fit your directory strucure. 

Download dlut_place_recognition to your personal package path: 
git clone https://github.com/ZhuangYanDLUT/dlut_smartrob.git ~/ros_workspace/

Build dlut_place_recognition: 
rosmake --rosdep-install dlut_place_recognition

If this fails and you can not figure out the solution, please check/ask for 
solutions at http://answers.ros.org/questions/?tags=dlut_place_recognition. 


USAGE ##########################################################################

To start 3D-SMART - Place Recognitionï¼š
rosrun dlut_place_recognition place_recognition

The following instructions assume you have owned database files, which are some
ones storing the global spatial features and local SURF features in database
scenes. Otherwise please create database files through two steps
Graph->Load Data (Ctrl+L) and Recognition->Extract Features (Ctrl+E) successively.

1. Please load 3D laser scanning data of query scene (Graph->Load Data (Ctrl+L));

2. Place recognition for query scene (Recognition->Place Recognition (Ctrl+P)).

Optionally, you can show query scene Bearing-Angle image (Graph->Show BA Image
(Ctrl+B)) and Flowsheet (Graph->Show Flowsheet (Ctrl+F)) of the software; Clicked
the "View" Menu, you can also show or hide 3D and 2D display.


FURTHER INFORMATION ############################################################

If you have any questions regarding usage of 3D-SMART - Place Recognition, please 
let me know or refer to our recent published paper for more detailed information 
(IEEE Transactions on Instrument and Measurement, Vol. 62, No. 2, 2013), you can
